"She is obviously not potty trained and pees and poops all over her house. She was in the mill for so long that she is also just not trainable. \n\nWe are OK with the peeing because we got her a female diaper and that works for us (although it is expensive). But the worst thing is that every time she poops she will chew it up and leave it in pieces smashed all over the floor. If we don\u2019t catch her pooping immediately; she will do it every time; and of course she does it every time we leave. It has been incredibly frustrating. \n\nHas anyone experienced this? Is there anything we can realistically do about it?""",2021-11-25T,,
I need help with my dog and feel lost. \n\nI have a 5 year old; boxer/mix that suffers from a lot of anxiety and I am unsure what to do moving forward. \n\nBackground: I adopted a boxer/mix from the local humane society back in 2019. Not much is known about his past prior to me but I can say when I adopted him; he didn't have any indications of being abused or neglected. He was a very happy dog; very well behaved (as far as aggression goes). However fast forward a few months and his issues became more apparent as he became more adjusted to living with a new owner. \n\nOutside of the house; my dog goes into immediate flight mode. Any little noise and he is yanking on his lease or If a car passes by; he will pull hard enough that I know he is chocking himself. He shakes and pants non-stop whenever we get into a car or pretty much leave the immediate area around my apartment. His tail is constantly tucked between his legs and he just doesn't seem to enjoy it. \n\nWhen he gets into these anxious episodes; I basically became invisible to him. He won't listen to me; look my direction; or take commands. The only thing on his mind is getting back home and will pull the direction of my apartment non-stop until he is back inside. \n\nI have tried a lot of different ways to address this such as CBD; prescription meds (Trazadone); and exposing him more and more to different outside areas. \n\nI know my dog isn't unhappy; or at least I don't think he is.,2021-11-17T,,
"I looked through the posts but felt I needed to post my own situation. I have a 4yr old neutered doggo that Ive had since he was 9 wks old; and in the last year almost 2 years now; he has been marking in our home when I leave. He has a dog door to go outside whenever he wants and 2 other dogs to keep him company; they get along. At first it was only on a boyfriends belongings; he's no longer around; he didn't like him too much (me either). But now whenever I leave him home he pees on my sons (3yr old) belongings; furniture; walls, etc .. he is very well potty trained and has been since he was a baby. I have reverted back to retraining him like taking him potty before leaving; before bed and all that. But still; whenever I go to work; go to the store; or wherever; I come home to pee marks and the smell of urine. He doesn't have a UTI or any other health concerns; I work at a vet clinic; so I've had him checked. He doesn't seem anxious compared to my German shepherd but maybe he's more stoic and just pees on our things? Any advice would be greatly appreciated; thank you!",2021-11-25T,,
Hi folks; I’m not a dog owner but I’ve been walking my mum’s dog every morning for the last 6 months; before I go to work.,2021-11-01T,,
Because we don’t have much time; I’ve been taking her to the nearest park; which is basically a square green with a few trees and a little river.,2021-11-09T,,
One time I was walking around the outside of my apartment complex on my way back home. I approached the front gate when I saw a little pug standing on the outside; looking in like he was waiting for somebody to let him in (you know the face).,2021-11-12T,,
