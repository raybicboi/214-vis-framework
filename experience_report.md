# Experience Report

One of the group members had issues for most of the week building and launching the project. A github issue was opened
for this issue and the members of the original group answered in a timely manner and provided multiple instances
of feedback.

Ultimately, the group member fixed the issue himself (and in our opinion), the issue was not in the scope of what 
the original group needed to provide help in. More specifically, there was an issue of a machine's javascript
heap running out of memory when launching the React application. There was no flaw in the original group's
implementation of the project.
